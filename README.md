# Playwright Test Example

This repository contains a simple example of using Playwright to create test scenarios. Playwright is a test framework used for automating tests in modern web browsers.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) should be installed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

cd PlayWrightTestExample_2


3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

npm install


## Usage

- To run the test scenarios, use the following command:

npm test


- During the execution of the scenarios, the browser will open automatically, and the tests will be performed.

- The test results will be logged in the console, and a screenshot named "screenshot.png" will be captured.

## Customizing Scenarios

- The `tests/code.test.js` file is an example that contains test scenarios. You can customize your tests by editing this file or adding new scenarios.

- For more information about the Playwright API, refer to the [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro/).
